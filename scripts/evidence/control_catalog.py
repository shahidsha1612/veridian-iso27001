"""
Control ID -> (section tag, control name) lookup, mirroring the grouping
in docs/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md (which itself mirrors the audit cheat
sheet's #tag sections). This is what gives every evidence artifact a
predictable path:

    evidence/controls/<section-slug>/<control-id>-<control-slug>/<timestamp>.json

so the local `evidence/` tree and the S3 vault's key prefixes are always
identical, and an auditor (or you) can find a control's evidence by
section without grepping filenames.
